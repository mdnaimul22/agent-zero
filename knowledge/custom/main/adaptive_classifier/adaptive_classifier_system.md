# Adaptive Classifier System - Dynamic ML Classification Framework

## Problem
Traditional machine learning classifiers suffer from critical limitations when deployed in real-world scenarios: they cannot dynamically add new classes without full retraining, lack robustness against adversarial manipulation, require complete retraining when new data arrives, and cannot adapt to evolving requirements. Additionally, existing systems struggle with strategic behavior where users attempt to game the classifier, and lack efficient state persistence for continuous learning scenarios.

## Content
The Adaptive Classifier solves these problems through a revolutionary architecture that combines four key components:

1. **Transformer Embeddings**: Uses state-of-the-art language models (BERT, ModernBERT, etc.) for text representation
2. **Prototype Memory**: Maintains class prototypes for quick adaptation to new examples using FAISS optimization
3. **Adaptive Neural Layer**: Learns refined decision boundaries through continuous training with EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation) protection against catastrophic forgetting
4. **Strategic Classification**: Defends against adversarial manipulation using game-theoretic principles with cost functions

### Key Capabilities
- **Dynamic Class Addition**: Add new classes without retraining existing ones
- **Continuous Learning**: Incrementally improve with new examples while preserving previous knowledge
- **Strategic Robustness**: 22.22% improvement on manipulated data with zero performance degradation
- **Memory Efficiency**: Safe and efficient state persistence with Hugging Face integration
- **Production Ready**: Zero downtime updates with batch processing capabilities

### Prediction Modes
- **Dual Mode**: Blended regular + strategic predictions (default)
- **Strategic Mode**: Simulates adversarial manipulation attempts
- **Robust Mode**: Anti-manipulation focused predictions
- **Prototype-Only**: Order-independent predictions for consistency-critical applications

## Usage
```python
from adaptive_classifier import AdaptiveClassifier

# Initialize classifier
classifier = AdaptiveClassifier("bert-base-uncased")

# Add examples dynamically
texts = ["Great product!", "Terrible experience"]
labels = ["positive", "negative"]
classifier.add_examples(texts, labels)

# Make predictions
predictions = classifier.predict("This is amazing!")

# Save and load states
classifier.save("./my_classifier")
loaded = AdaptiveClassifier.load("./my_classifier")

# Strategic classification with anti-gaming
config = {
    'enable_strategic_mode': True,
    'cost_function_type': 'linear',
    'strategic_blend_regular_weight': 0.6,
    'strategic_blend_strategic_weight': 0.4
}
classifier = AdaptiveClassifier("bert-base-uncased", config=config)
```
