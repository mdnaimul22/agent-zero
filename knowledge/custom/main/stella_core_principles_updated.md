# STELLA: Self-Evolving LLM Agent - Core Principles

## Overview
STELLA (Self-Evolving LLM Agent) is a generalist AI agent built on the principle of self-evolution, specifically designed for biomedical research. It addresses the limitation of current AI agents that rely on static, predefined capabilities in a constantly evolving field.

The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. STELLA is designed to overcome these limitations through continuous self-improvement and autonomous capability expansion.

## Core Principles

### 1. Self-Evolution
- The fundamental principle underlying STELLA is continuous self-improvement
- The agent autonomously enhances its own capabilities through experience
- Overcomes the limitations of static, manually curated toolsets
- Performance systematically improves with experience; for instance, accuracy on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials

### 2. Multi-Agent Architecture
- Employs a multi-agent system design
- Enables autonomous improvement of capabilities
- Facilitates complex problem-solving through specialized sub-agents
- Allows the agent to learn from experience and dynamically scale its expertise

### 3. Evolving Template Library
- Core mechanism for improving reasoning strategies
- Templates evolve over time based on experience and performance
- Enables the agent to develop better problem-solving approaches

### 4. Dynamic Tool Ocean
- Expands automatically as the agent encounters new challenges
- New tools are created by a dedicated Tool Creation Agent
- Eliminates dependency on predefined, static toolsets
- Tool Creation Agent automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools

### 5. Autonomous Capability Expansion
- Automatically learns and adapts from new data and experiences
- Continuously grows its knowledge base and skill set
- Maintains relevance in rapidly evolving domains like biomedicine

## Experimental Results and Performance

STELLA has been evaluated on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy:

- Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine - 26%
- LAB-Bench: DBQA - 54%
- LAB-Bench: LitQA - 63%

These results show that STELLA outperforms leading models by up to 6 percentage points. More importantly, its performance systematically improves with experience.

## Technical Abilities

- Continuous learning and adaptation from new experiences
- Automatic expansion of toolset capabilities
- Evolution of reasoning strategies through template library updates
- Specialized performance in complex biomedical research tasks
- Integration of diverse data sources and tools
- Dynamic scaling of expertise to accelerate biomedical discovery

## Domain Focus
- Specifically designed for biomedical research
- Handles the constant evolution of biomedical data and literature
- Addresses the fragmentation of the biomedical research landscape

This framework represents a significant advancement in AI agent design, moving from static systems to truly self-evolving entities that can keep pace with rapidly changing domains.
