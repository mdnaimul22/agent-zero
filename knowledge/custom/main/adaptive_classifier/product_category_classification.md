# Product Category Classification - E-commerce Taxonomy with Adaptive Classifiers

## Problem
E-commerce platforms struggle with accurate product categorization across complex hierarchical taxonomies. Traditional classification systems fail to handle the nuanced relationships between product descriptions, features, and hierarchical category structures. Manual categorization is labor-intensive and error-prone, while automated systems often misclassify products due to semantic ambiguity and category overlap.

## Content
The product category classification system demonstrates adaptive classifier capabilities for e-commerce taxonomy through comprehensive hierarchical categorization. Key innovations include:

1. **Hierarchical Category Learning**: Maps product descriptions to complex category paths like "/Appliances/Refrigerators/French Door Refrigerators" with high accuracy
2. **Feature-Based Classification**: Leverages detailed product specifications (materials, dimensions, features) for precise categorization
3. **Cross-Category Generalization**: Learns to categorize diverse product types from tools and appliances to safety equipment and automotive parts
4. **Real-World Dataset**: Demonstrates with 200+ actual product examples across 50+ hierarchical categories from major e-commerce platforms

The system handles complex categorization challenges like distinguishing between "/Building Materials/Concrete Tools" vs "/Tools/Hand Tools" based on nuanced product descriptions and intended use cases.

## Usage
```python
# Product category classification example
classifier = AdaptiveClassifier("distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased")

# Training examples with hierarchical categories
products = [
    {
        "tool": "20V MAX XR Brushless Cordless Hammer Drill",
        "description": "Features 3-speed transmission and LED work light...",
        "category": "/Tools/Power Tools/Drills/Hammer Drills"
    },
    {
        "tool": "36-inch French Door Refrigerator",
        "description": "25 cu. ft. capacity with LED lighting and external dispenser...",
        "category": "/Appliances/Refrigerators/French Door Refrigerators"
    }
]

# Train classifier
for product in products:
    classifier.add_examples([product["description"]], [product["category"]])

# Predict category for new product
prediction = classifier.predict("Smart refrigerator with WiFi and ice maker")
```
