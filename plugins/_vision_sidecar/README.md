# Vision Sidecar

![Vision Sidecar](webui/thumbnail.jpg)

Tolerant `vision_load` + optional dedicated Vision Model.

## Why

Two recurring pain points in Agent Zero:

1. **Bare-string bug.** Core `vision_load` requires `paths` as a list. A bare string `"/a.png"` is iterated char-by-char, loads 0 images, and wastes a turn with no error.
2. **No vision, no images.** Frontier reasoners (GLM 5.2/5.3, DeepSeek V4 Flash/Pro) are cheap and strong but have no vision. On stock A0 that means no `vision_load` at all — even though a cheap `gpt-4o-mini` or `qwen2-vl` could read the image for pennies.

Vision Sidecar fixes both in one plugin.

## What it does

### 1. Tolerant `vision_load`

`vision_load` now accepts `paths` as `string` or `list[str]`.

- `{"paths": "/a.png"}` is treated as `["/a.png"]`
- Handles harness quirks: JSON-encoded array strings (`"[\"/a.png\"]"`), quoted single paths (`"\"/a.png\""`) 
- Wrong types return a clear tool error — never a `Message misformat`

### 2. Delegated Vision Model

Configure an optional **Vision Model** in **Settings → Model Presets → Vision Model**.

> Optional dedicated model for vision_load — used when Main has no vision. Leave empty to use Main's vision.

When set:

- `vision_load(paths, query?, raw?)` materializes images, calls the Vision Model with `query + images`, and returns a **text capsule** instead of injecting `~1500 tok/image` into the main history.
- Your Main (GLM, DeepSeek) never sees raw pixels — only ~300 tokens of focused text. Saves thousands of tokens per future turn.
- `query` is a focused instruction: `"read the top-right error toast"`, `"locate the login button and give coordinates"`. Empty → generic precise description.
- `raw=true` bypasses delegation and injects images directly into Main. Use for side-by-side comparison when Main must see pixels.
- Large images over ~900 KB are auto-compressed to 1280×960 JPEG before the vision call to avoid `Request Entity Too Large` (4 MB PNG → ~250 KB).

When empty: legacy path — images are injected as `RawMessage` for `chat_model.vision == true`, appearance identical to stock A0.

Preset defaults for the Vision slot: **64000 context, 70% for history** (new presets only). Existing presets are untouched.

## Requirements

- Agent Zero. If your **Settings → Model Presets → Edit** already shows **Main / Vision / Utility / Embedding** (only if you're updating the plugin), nothing else to do.
- If it only shows **Main / Utility / Embedding** (on any A0 instance), run the one-time Vision-slot patch below — otherwise Vision Sidecar still works, but `vision_load` falls back to tolerant direct injection (no delegation).
- Any LiteLLM-compatible vision model for the Vision slot (tested with `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `qwen2-vl`).

## Installation

### From ZIP

1. Download `vision_sidecar.zip` from Releases
2. Agent Zero → **Settings → Plugins → Install → From ZIP** → select the ZIP
3. Add the Vision slot via the script (check below)
4. Restart the WebUI (`Ctrl+Shift+R`)

### From Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GreifMax/a0-vision-sidecar
cp -r a0-vision_sidecar /a0/usr/plugins/vision_sidecar
# restart Agent Zero
```

### Add Vision slot

Since **v0.4.0** the Vision slot is applied **automatically on install** (via the plugin's `install()` hook) — no manual step. If Model Presets still shows only Main / Utility / Embedding (e.g. after an A0 core update overwrote `plugins/_model_config`), re-run it in one click:

- **Settings → Plugins → Vision Sidecar → Execute** (preferred), or
- the manual script below (same logic, also usable for `--status` / `--restore`)

The patcher is **self-contained pure Python** — no git or `patch(1)` required, idempotent, and creates `.vision_sidecar.bak` backups of every modified file.

```bash
# any directory works; it auto-finds the Agent Zero root
bash /a0/usr/plugins/vision_sidecar/scripts/enable_vision_slot.sh
# or:  python3 /a0/usr/plugins/vision_sidecar/scripts/enable_vision_slot.py
```

Docker (run **inside** the Agent Zero container, not on the host — `plugins/` only exists in the image):

```bash
docker exec -it <agent-zero-container> bash /a0/usr/plugins/vision_sidecar/scripts/enable_vision_slot.sh
```

Options:

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| (no args) | Apply patch (skips files already patched) |
| `--status` | Show per-file state without changing anything |
| `--restore` | Restore all original files from `.bak` backups |

If auto-detection fails, point it at your install: `A0_ROOT=/path/to/agent-zero bash enable_vision_slot.sh`.

Then restart Agent Zero and hard-refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R). Model Presets will show **Main / Vision / Utility / Embedding**.

> Note: A0 updates can overwrite `plugins/_model_config`. After updating, rerun the script — it is idempotent and will re-apply cleanly.

## Configuration

1. **Settings → Model Presets → Edit** → fill **Vision Model** with your cheap vision helper (provider + name + key). Leave empty to use Main's vision.
2. **Main Model → Supports Vision on** → optional **Overrides Vision Model** switch appears right under it: when on, Main's native vision is always used for that preset and the Vision Model is ignored; when off (default), the dedicated Vision Model handles vision when configured. The chat model switcher hides the Vision row for presets where the override is on, and the Agent Config preset preview shows "Overwritten by Main" in place of the Vision model when the override is active.
3. **Settings → Plugins → Vision Sidecar** → tune the delegated system prompt and timeout if needed.

New presets automatically get `Vision: 64000 / 0.7`. Current presets keep their values. The override flag is per-preset (never inherited from Default).

## Usage (By A0)

```json
{
  "tool_name": "vision_load",
  "tool_args": {
    "paths": ["/a0/usr/uploads/screenshot.png"],
    "query": "read the error message in the top-right"
  }
}
```

- With Vision Model set -> chat shows thumbnails + `N images sent, M images skipped - Description: "..."` (counts + vision-model capsule in one line). The tool step always includes a Query row (Paths / Tool Name / Query / Result), even when the call omitted `query`.
- The delegated `vision_load` prompt declares an explicit JSON tool schema (`paths`, `query`, `raw`), so models see `query` as a real parameter. When the Main model overrides vision (or there is no Vision Model), the stock prompt is used and `query` is absent from the schema. The schema rejects unknown properties (`additionalProperties: false`), and the tool normalizes prompt-style aliases (`Prompt`, `question`, `instruction`, ...) into `query`, so the vision model always receives the intended focus text even if a model ignores the schema.
- With `raw=true` → forces direct injection even when Vision Model is set.
- Without Vision Model -> fully stock: stock prompt (no `query`/`raw`), `Loaded images: N` with thumbnails for Main vision, and no vision tool at all when Main has no vision.
- With **Overrides Vision Model** on (Main vision-capable presets) -> Main's native vision is used even though a Vision Model is set; delegation (and the switcher's Vision row) is skipped for that preset.

## Reliability notes

- `vision_load` is safe inside the `parallel` tool: the job result is the real text capsule (or error), never a placeholder — the tool sets the authoritative response message in every outcome path.
- Image blocks are injected into main history only when the preset's main model declares vision support (delegated and legacy paths alike). With a text-only main, delegated calls return the text capsule only and `raw=true` auto-delegates.
- The `vision` flag is the user's declaration and governs: if it mislabels a text-only provider, the provider may reject image blocks (`400 content.type invalid`) — fix the flag in Model Presets; the text capsule still carries the answer meanwhile.
- Inside `parallel` workers the tool writes the `Result` row of its log item. The parent job aggregator skips the body text write when the Result row already carries the same text, so the step shows the text only once (inside the Result row). Errors and tools without a Result row still get body text.
- With no Vision Model configured and a text-only main, the tool reports loaded/skipped counts plus an explicit note that images were not injected.
