# STELLA: Self-Evolving LLM Agent - Core Principles

## Overview
STELLA (Self-Evolving LLM Agent) is a generalist AI agent built on the principle of self-evolution, specifically designed for biomedical research. It addresses the limitation of current AI agents that rely on static, predefined capabilities in a constantly evolving field.

## Core Principles

### 1. Self-Evolution
- The fundamental principle underlying STELLA is continuous self-improvement
- The agent autonomously enhances its own capabilities through experience
- Overcomes the limitations of static, manually curated toolsets

### 2. Multi-Agent Architecture
- Employs a multi-agent system design
- Enables autonomous improvement of capabilities
- Facilitates complex problem-solving through specialized sub-agents

### 3. Evolving Template Library
- Core mechanism for improving reasoning strategies
- Templates evolve over time based on experience and performance
- Enables the agent to develop better problem-solving approaches

### 4. Dynamic Tool Ocean
- Expands automatically as the agent encounters new challenges
- New tools are created by a dedicated Tool Creation Agent
- Eliminates dependency on predefined, static toolsets

### 5. Autonomous Capability Expansion
- Automatically learns and adapts from new data and experiences
- Continuously grows its knowledge base and skill set
- Maintains relevance in rapidly evolving domains like biomedicine

## Key Contributions
